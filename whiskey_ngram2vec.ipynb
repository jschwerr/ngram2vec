    "* For the most part I elected to used RDD's to hold data instead of data frames. Data frames are more intuitive but RDD's usually have faster computation times.\n",
    "* The data I used for this model came from a list of scotch reviews that I found online. It consists of about 2,000 records and its schema is printed below. The limited amount of data we have lends to our model performing more poorly than it would if we had more data."
